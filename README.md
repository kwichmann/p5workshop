## Exercises

### 1.1 Setting up and choosing background color
- Log in to the p5 editor using a Google or Github account. Or create an account if you have neither of those.
- Choose a canvas size fitting your tastes and screen size.
- Make the background a shade of gray.
- Make the background yellow.
- Make the background your favorite color.

This [Color picker](https://www.google.com/search?q=color+picker) might be helpful.

### 1.2 Dots, stroke, and stroke weight
- Put a large, green dot at the upper right part of the canvas.
- Create a small group of dots of different sizes and colors at a region of the canvas of your choice. They should have coordinate sets close to each other, but not identical.

### 1.3 Rectangles
- Make a rectangle with stroke and fill colors of your choice so that it does no overlap the group of dot from last exercise.
- Make a rectangle that frames the group of dots. Make sure it has no fill.



## Finally, create your own piece of abstract art
Use what you've learned to compose a work of your own. Use the examples above, either as inspiration, or choose one to recreate:

**When you're done, send the link to your sketch to p5workshop2020@gmail.com - I will make a gallery of the contributions**

# 2. Interaction using built-in variables

## Exercises

### 2.1 Width and height of canvas
- Use the built-in width and height variables to draw a circle centered at the middle of the canvas.
- Changes the size of the canvas in the createCanvas command, and check that the circle is now drawn at the new center.

### 2.2 Using the mouse to draw
- This might work better in a fresh sketch, so feel free to save your work and start a new one.
- Draw a dot at the current mouse position.
- What happens if, instead of calling the background command in draw, you call it setup (i.e. only once)? If in doubt, consult picture to the right.
- What happens if you give the stroke color some alpha? (If in doubt, see cheat sheet)
- Remove the alpha from the stroke color. Put the background command back into draw. Give the background color some alpha instead. What happens?
- Change the sketch, so that instead of a dot, a line from the previous mouse position to the current one is drawn.
